## Installation

### Windows Installer

- You can run our [windows installer](https://github.com/ctmm-initiative/ctmmweb/releases/download/v0.2.10/ctmmwebsetup.exe) which will guide through these steps in a wizard style:
  - Install R. This could be skipped if you already have R installed.
    Note it's possible to have multiple versions of R installed, however that may require more knowledge and tweaks. For example if you had a R 3.6 version Rscript.exe in windows PATH but just installed R 4.0 without uninstall R 3.6, the installer will fail because a R 3.6 Rscript will be used to install the packages.
    We suggest to always install and keep the latest R version to avoid possible problems.
    Installing R to `Program Files` could cause further permission problems([see discussion](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#Does-R-run-under-Windows-Vista_003f)), we suggest to install R to a user writable folder.
  - Install `ctmmweb` package from github.
  - Start `ctmmweb` app.
  - Shortcuts for the app and a self update script can be created in program menu too.


### Install with R

1. Install R

    Download R installer([win](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/4.0.0/R-4.0.0-win.exe), [mac](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-4.0.0.pkg), [Linux](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/)) and install R.

    *[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) is recommended but not a must.*

2. Start R

    Start `R console` from start menu (or RStudio if installed). All code below will run inside it.

3. Install app

    ```r
    if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_github("ctmm-initiative/ctmmweb")
    
    ```

4. Run app

    ```r
    ctmmweb::app()
    ```

## FAQ

- If you met errors in install/upgrade lots of packages, restart R session and install again often can solve the problem. 
- The app is started with default browser. Chrome is recommended as some other browsers have known limitations.

### Linux
- Following instructions [here for installing R](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/) (assuming Ubuntu or Linux Mint). Make sure to install `r-base-dev` too.
- RStudio have installer for Linux.
- Some of the packages needed for the app need extra steps to install properly:
  + We recommend to use `remotes` instead of `devtools` as `remotes` has much less dependencies and often have less package installation problems([because devtools itself need many more packages which cannot be upgraded easily in one session](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/issues/2223)).
  + If you are using `devtools`, it need `libcurl`, `ssl` in linux if it's not already installed in your system. You can watch error messages to check what is required. I installed them in Linux Mint 18 with
  
        sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
        sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
